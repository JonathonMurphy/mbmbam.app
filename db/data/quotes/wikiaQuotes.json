          "Murder Mystery party ideas?",
          "I'm organising a murder mystery party for my friends and need some help with ideas. I'm not using a shop-bought kit for the night and have come up with a basic storyline myself. Basically a Lord invited everyone round for dinner earlier that week, but the morning of the night he was murdered. Every guest is a suspect because they all disliked the Lord for reasons to do with money and flirtatious behaviour. It turns out in the end that the son was the murderer because he was the Lord's favourite and wanted to inherit all of his money. \n",
          "I'm looking for ideas to do with ways to reveal clues throughout the night, through games etc. I wouldn't mind if they were quite scary but they should be fun too (Also, nothing too complicated please). I would love it if you gave examples in your answers! :) \n",
